<i><p>No piece of literature is limited to just one theme, in fact, almost all pieces of literature have more than one theme that the author is displaying. Just like "Frankenstein", written by Mary Shelley, and published in 1818, there are many themes that Shelley presents. Dangerous Knowledge in Frankenstein Dangerous knowledge is a prominently seen theme in Frankenstein. </p></i>

<i><p>Dangerous knowledge, also referred to as the pursuit of knowledge, is seen as one of the main theme of Frankenstein. The theme "dangerous knowledge" is shown repetitively throughout the novel. Readers see the search for knowledge from the major characters: Victor Frankenstein. He is seeking something farther than any other person has gone before, and leads to dangerous places and situations; it is traveling beyond the accepted boundaries of knowledge that is the downfall of characters which lead to undesired circumstances and suffering. We see how their thirst for knowledge can bring them to places, and they can eventually find what they are looking for, but it eventually takes them to places that are dangerous, and unwanted. The strive for such knowledge drives one to his grave, and brings the other to realization of what could happen if he does not cease. </p></i>



<b><p>Meaning of Dangerous Knowledge </p></b>
<i><p>Dangerous knowledge is essentially knowledge that is too far reach, and too beyond human capabilities. It is also knowledge that if used incorrectly and put in the wrong hands it can end up very badly.
</p></i>  
<b><p>Victor Frankenstein </p></b>

<i><p>Since Victor was a kid, he has always been intrigued by learning new 
information and making new discoveries. This was a time when Victor's discoveries were for the good according to society and there was no harm done. However, as his experimentation began to escalate, so did his <b>"thirst for knowledge"</b>, which inevitably became uncontrollable.  When Victor is in the process of making his creation, he is going beyond the human limits. It was his uncontrollable thirst for knowledge that ignores all the warnings, precautions and boundaries; yet he still insists to attain access to the secrets of life.  As he is in the midst of creating his monster, he does not take into account the consequences that could be impacted by his actions. He was blinded by his own desires that he did not see the destruction he was creating for himself.  After he finishes his experiment that is when the consequences impacted him the most. He realized that everything that was most dear to him was to be ruined because of his selfish actions. Eventually, he reaches the inevitable fate he had created for himself. He became so focused on forbidden knowledge that he did not see that he was slowly killing himself.</p>
<p>
Victor Frankenstein finds himself exploring the world of science, and learning about science, against his father's wishes, but Victor urges to go forward with his studies and goes off to university. At this point in time, science was an area of little knowledge, especially chemistry, which was Victor's area of study. He continues on in search of the answers to death, and pursues to go beyond what are normal human limits. Victor soon finds the answer he was looking for, and discovers the answer to life. Through Victor's new-found knowledge and discoveries, he becomes obsessed with making a human being. Such a human that it should be a perfect creature in size strength and intelligence. His so-called addiction forces him to gather dead body parts and create this monster that will prove to be very dangerous. Once the monster vanishes after its creation, Victors soon realizes what he has done, and what he has become, and where his pursuit of knowledge has taken him. When the creature comes back around, Victor's actions end up in the destruction of everything he ever loved and valued. This leaving the monster, and himself, alone, together, and driving them both to their deaths.

</p></i>

<b><p>The Creature </p></b>
<i><p>The Creature is also a character who we see yearn for knowledge that proves to be dangerous. He comes across many experiences that make his yearning greater, and he goes to great extents to learn to speak, and interact with people. He learns to become a real human being, and tires to fit in with everyone else. Examples of the monster experiencing new things can be seen when he learns to speak, discovers his sense, finds food for himself, and observes the moon. The creature tries to fit in and be like other humans. The monster hopes to gain knowledge in hopes of no longer being shunned and beaten on and attacked by society for the way he is. When his urge to fit in and gain knowledge fails and it backfires, he seeks revenge and becomes violent. After the death of Victor, not much is known of the fate of the monster, but the monster surely met his fate as well, thus proving he search for knowledge to be very dangerous</p></i>
