<i><p>We will examine the homosexuality inherent in the horrific birth in Frankenstein. We consider those impulse that represent the acceptable manifestations of homosocial desires by examining the socially deviant homosexuality evident in the <b>Creator-Creature</b> relationship. In this story we shall focus on the Victor’s relationship with his Creature (a scientific creation). The Creature is a Victor’s supplement, a representation of his creator’s repressed sexuality. In his grotesque frame and inability to gain human sympathy and social acceptance, the Creature is  Victor’s double a  manifestation of his creator’s sexual identity. The doubling reveals Victor’s paradoxical relationship with his repressed sexuality. Throughout the text, Victor hides from his double as an act of rejection of his sexual identity, but conversely seeks  his Creature, struggles to repress the presence of his creature in two courtroom scenes, and pursues his Creature in order to emphasize Victor’s oscillating repellence of an attraction to his culturally deviant sexuality. </p></i>

<i><p>Early  in Frankenstein , Victor was very obsessed to artificially create Human life. The protagonist explains , “one of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted attention was the structure of the human frame ”. The “peculiar” attraction Victor has for the human  specifically for the male body leads him to conduct secret research at night when the darkness  has no effect upon his fancy, and the church yard was merely receptacle of bodies deprived of life was led to examine the cause and  progress of this decay, and force to spend nights in charnel houses. Victor’s pervasive action on the burial plots and rotting corpses  serves as a violent and penetrative act that denote the male sexual desire to penetrate a receptacle. Because grave-digging is illegal and Victor recognizes his illegality and his grotesque research has no effect on his fancy, these action locate his obsession in social deviance. In addition, “the restless, and almost frantic impulse which urged Victor forward “  and  “unrelaxed and breathless “ connotes Victor’s erotic anticipation or “pre-orgasmic language” in his manipulation of male body parts. The research process evokes sexual penetration that is grotesque and culturally forbidden.  </p></i>

<i><p>The idea of creating and possessing another male body  appeals to Victor’s subconscious desires, but the moment the Creature animate results  in the former’s forced recognition of his repressed sexuality. Victor assembles his Creature , whose “limbs were in proportion ” and “selected features were beautiful”. The creature attractive artificial embodies a homosexual figure functioning  as Victor’s  sexual identity and an object of sexual desire. But when the body becomes it’s own agent it turns from beautiful to ugly and deformed. 
</p></i>  

<i><p>Victor’s supplement is inappropriate, unnatural and forbidden in a homophobic era of Britain, when the surveillance of suspected homosexuals pervaded the private and the public spheres , and sadomy  was punishable by death. Thus the Creature serves as a marker of Victor’s sexual identity , and the fact that the former agency not only forces Victor to register his own sexuality , but the Creature’s presence also poses  a threat to out Victor as a homosexual. Therefore Victor cannot endure the Creatures visibility so he “rushes out of the laboratory” upon seeing his creation.
