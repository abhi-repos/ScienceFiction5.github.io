<i><p>Frankenstein is a classic horror novel, but with a twist of many other genres. Written by Mary Shelley, it was a novel which mixed many exciting elements, such as horror, drama and romance. The story follows a young doctor named Victor Frankenstein, who has an obsession to reincarnate the dead, but his attempts at this fail horribly, and Victor finds himself in deep peril, as the monster stalks him throughout the world. I aim to investigate the issue, however, of who is the true monster in Frankenstein. The monster or Frankensteinhimself? </p></i>

<i><p>Mary Shelley, the creator of Frankenstein.She was a highly intellectual and creative woman, one of the elite writers in Britain.Her inspiration for Frankenstein was taken from several things. The plan itself for Frankenstein was taken from a dream, but her theories of life and explanation of the human anatomy came from noted scientists, philosophers and alchemists from Europe. This spawned the seed of the monster of Frankenstein, an intellectual creature, a lover of music,poetry and other such sophisticated occupancies.  </p></i>

<i><p> Friendship is one of the most common human desires found all over the world . In Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, this  need is explored, especially as it reveals itself in the hearts of three great men. Captain Walden writes to his sister about the loneliness that he is experiencing on his journey at the very start of the book. Then, as the story progresses, a similar want can be found in Victor despite his tightly intertwinr relationship with Henry Clerval. The Creature is constantly denied his lust for companionship demonstrates the horrible consequences of unending loneliness. His friendly nature combined with his comically appearance proves to be a horrific combination that serves only in gaining rejection, quite irrationally, over and over again by all living beings. The Creature's suffering could only be abandoned if he were able to encounter an unprejudiced and completely tolerant friend.
</p></i>  

<i><p>  Shelley masterfully conveys the importance of a kindred spirit and the overall necessity of loyalty between people.Shelly defines friendship from her chapter as  she found a true friend named M.Waldman,she desrcibed him as a: His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism; and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge, and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.
