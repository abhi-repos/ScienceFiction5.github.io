<b><p>Romanticism:-</p></b>
<i><p>Impact of Industrial revolution can we shown on all form of society, including the way how people thought, felt, worked, and related to each other.This may be the reason why romanticism is adopted so quickly. Romanticism is considered as a reaction to hyper-active period which was needed to deal with backlash of Enlightement's scientific thoughts and concerns. Romanticism help people to free their arms, to explore more, to dream more, to have more fantasies whereas everything was predictable due to Enlightenment and taking fun out of life, It was first expressed by English poet later these ideals  of Romanticism spread to other artistic models ex. arts, music and even to other countries. this is one of the major reason why the value of arts, emotion and the value of individual was able to reestablish a place in minds and practices of people and society.</p></i>
<b><p> Element Of Romanticism in frankiestien:-</p></b>
<i><p>Mary Shelley a gem of English literature manipulates and uses nature as a device to convey emotions, disturbance and even joy at many different time throughout the novel.here is a scene in Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein, in which victor after a long wait finally meets his creature: "a few shattered 
 pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial nature  was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche  or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains" , these few lines shows Mary Shelley loves for nature and how beautifully she linked nature with joy of victor. The distinct mood created by the fragmented, rocky landscape, the thunderous cracks of the calving glacier in Shelley's description the echoing off of the mountains… the connection is obvious, and the state of mind similar - one of dread, of terror,of impending conflict.  </p></i>

<i><p> 
There are some other instances in novel which also reflect similarities to the element of romanticism. There is section of bringing to life of Frankenstein's creature, nature is used extremely similar. “It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils… It was already one in the morning; the ran  pattered dismally against the panes…” (Shelley 56). Illuminated by the dim and waning light from his candle, Victor  then sees the “dull yellow eye” of his creature open. Heavy breathing and suddenly the engine of heart sputter to life; and his limb starts to move.
</p></i>  
                    <p><i>
The great apprehension and poe ambiance cast by the weather outside is reflected inside of the creature Frankenstein once beheld as beautiful  with horrid  descriptions . There are some more element like,"no one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success” (52). The very nature of the subject matter that Mary Shelley is grappling with here is,in its very essence, sublime.

From couple of examples stated above, From this it is evident that we can gather another aspect of Romanticism exemplified in  Frankenstein.</i></p>

 <blockquote>From the past couple of examples, it is evident that we can gather another aspect of Romanticism exemplified in Frankenstein: capturing the sublime moment and experience. </blockquote>
