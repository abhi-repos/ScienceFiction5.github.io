<b><p>Romanticism:-</p></b>
<i><p>The Industrial Revolution had impacted all forms of society, including how people thought, felt, worked, and related to each other, it would not be totally crazy to think that such a change might have been the reason why Romanticism was quickly adopted. Romanticism as a reaction to the hyper-active period of change might have been the only way to deal with the backlash of the Enlightenment's scientific thoughts and concerns.Romanticism gave people spontaneity, the chance to dream again, to explore fantasy, whereas the Enlightenment made everything predictable, taking the fun out of life. First expressed by the English poets, these ideals of Romanticism spread to other artistic models, such as art and music, and on to other countries. Because of this,the value of the arts, emotions and the value of the individual was able to reestablish a place in the minds and
practices of people and society.</p></i>
<b><p> Element Of Romanticism in frankiestien:-</p></b>
<i><p>Mary Shelley manipulates Nature and uses it as a device to convey emotions, turmoil, even joy at different times throughout the novel. Like most of Byron’s work, especially in Childe Harold, this sort of reflective quality of Nature is heavily employed. Most notably in Harold, in Canto 3 is the section on the Thunderstorm in the Alps. “Far along, / From peak to peak, the rattling crags among / Leaps the live thunder! Not from one lone cloud, But every mountain now hath found a tongue” . Notice the striking similarity to the scene in Shelley in which Victor finally meets his Creature: “a few shattered  pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking, rberated along the mountains” . The distinct mood created by the fragmented,rocky landscape, the thunderous cracks of the calving glacier in Shelley’s description and the thunder in Byron’s, the echoing off of the mountains… the connection is obvious, and the state of mind similar - one of dread, of terror, of impending conflict.  </p></i>

<i><p>In the section of the bringing to life of Frankenstein’s Creature, nature is used extremely similarly. “It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils… It was already one in the morning; the ran pattered dismally against the panes…”. Illuminated by the dim and waning light from his candle, Victor  then sees the “dull yellow eye” of his creature open. It breathes heavily. The engine of his heart sputters to life; motion enters his limbs. The dread and Poe-like ambiance cast by the weather outside is reflected inside with horrid 
descriptions of the creature Frankenstein once beheld as beautiful. Frankenstein’s quest for playing God and instilling in an inanimate collection of body parts the spark of life is just as much a grasping for the sublime as Blake’s questioning of the very God Frankenstein is trying to (at least symbolically) become. Upon finding out that he beheld the power of animation, he expressed his amazement: “no one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success”. The very nature of the subject matter that Mary Shelley is grappling with here is, in its very essence, sublime. 
</p></i>  

 <blockquote>From the past couple of examples, it is evident that we can gather another aspect of Romanticism exemplified in Frankenstein: capturing the sublime moment and experience. </blockquote>
