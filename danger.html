<b><p>What is this theme of Dangerous Knowledge about?</p></b>
<i><p>The concept of “dangerous knowledge” as a theme is used throughout Mary Shelley’s novel "Frankenstein" as Victor was surrounded by destruction and pain until his last days. His spirits involving adventure not only affected him but also the people in its vicinity. In this novel "Frankenstein," by Mary Shelly, Robert Walton and Victor Frankenstein are compared on their mutual sense of knowledge, interest and adventure which revolves around their brains. They both possess the same thirst for knowledge.  </p></i>

<b><p>What Inspired Mary Shelley to use Dangers of Knowledge? </p></b>
<i><p>The author was inspired to write this novel in 1816 when she was on her trip to Switzerland with her husband Percy Shelley. There the couple met British poet Lord Byron and read German ghost stories throughout the summer. During that time period, the science era was just to begin to take off in society, especially in chemistry. Many scientists have discovered a lot in chemistry in that century. So the author of this novel used these exciting advances of what she read in the novels in her work . </p></i>



<b><p>The Description of Dangerous Knowledge in detail:</p></b>
                    <i><p>In this novel we saw the excitement and search for learning and knowledge in three major characters, Victor Frankenstein, Robert Walton, and the creature. We saw that how their hunger for knowledge can bring them to places, and they can eventually find what they are looking for. But it eventually takes them to places that are dangerous, and unwanted. Victor Frankenstein was a scientist who was excited to learn and study against his father's wishes, He was a student at Ingolstadt and took course of chemistry and the creation of life. But he wants to learn and went forward with his studies and goes off to university. Victor’s interest is to learn chemistry, which was an area of rare knowledge, because there was a very little scope of science at that time. Victor's ambitions were shot down by M. Kempe. He was always used to be insulted by M.Krempe, even though his ambitions didn’t let him down and continues to search for the answers to death, and chosed to go beyond normal human limits. Very soon he was successful in finding the answer for what he was eager to know about, and discovers the answer to life. Alas! his dream came true was actually the stuff which he did not want to be in reality.

</i></p>
                <i><p>When the monster roams around the town then Victor realizes that what he has done and where his pursuit of knowledge has taken him to that what which he never wanted to walk on. The knowledge that Frankestein possessed created something which he would have never wanted it. He can smell the dust of the destruction that came along after the creation of monster. The creation of the monster made him isolated, sick, sad, and miserable for the rest of his life. He was literally punished by the knowledge which had gained it against many people including his father. </i></p>
