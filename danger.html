<b><p>What is this theme?</p></b>
<i><p>The concept of dangerous knowledge is used throughout Mary Shelleyâ€™s novel "Frankenstein" as pain and destruction follow Victor until his last days. Their adventurous spirits not only affected themselves but also the people around them. In Mary Shelley's novel "Frankenstein," the comparison between Robert Walton and Victor Frankenstein revolves around their mutual sense of adventure and unquenchable desire for knowledge. Robert and Victor possess the same thirst for knowledge. </p></i>

<b><p>What Inspired Mary Shelley to use Dangers of Knowledge? </p></b>
<i><p>Mary Shelley was inspired to write her novel "Frankenstein" during her trip to Switzerland with husband Percy Shelley in 1816, where the couple met British poet Lord Byron and read German ghost stories throughout the summer. During this time period science was just beginning to take off in society, especially chemistry. Mary Shelley used these exciting advances in her work. </p></i>



<b><p>The Theme in detail:</p></b>
<i><p>In Frankenstein we see the search for learning and knowledge in three major characters, Victor Frankenstein, Robert Walton, and the creature. We see how their thirst for knowledge can bring them to places, and they can eventually find what they are looking for, but it eventually takes them to places that are dangerous, and unwanted. Victor Frankenstein was a scientist who was excited to learn and study. He was a student at Ingolstadt and pursued chemistry and the creation of life. Against his father's wishes, but he urges to go forward with his studies and goes off to university. At that time, science was an area of little knowledge, especially chemistry, which was Victor's area of interest. Victor's ambitions were shot down by M. Kempe and was insulted by him, even though he continues on in search of the answers to death, and pursues to go beyond what are normal human limits. Victor soon finds the answer he was looking for, and discovers the answer to life. But his dream that came true was actually something he did not want. When the monster roams around the town Victor realizes what he has done and where his pursuit of knowledge has taken him.. The knowledge Victor possessed created something that he believed he wanted until he saw the destruction that came along with it. The creation of the monster made Victor alone and miserable for the rest of his life.
</p></i>                    

 <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>
